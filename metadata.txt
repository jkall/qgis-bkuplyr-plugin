name=Backup shapefile
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=This plugin backups the selected shapefile layer and stores in a zipped file with current date time stamp
version=0.1
author=Josef Källgården
email=groundwatergis@gmail.com

about=This plugin will create a compressed (zip container) archive of the currently selected shapefile layer (and associated files). The compressed archive file will be saved in the original shapefile directory, with current date and time appended to file name. This way you can easily, from within qgis, create a backup copy of your shapefile before start editing.
